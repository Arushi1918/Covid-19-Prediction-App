# Covid-19-Prediction-App
COVID-19 started in the Chinese province of Hubei's Wuhan in December 2019. Since then, several waves of covid-19 have hit people all around the world. As the whole world was striving to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), healthcare and health monitoring systems were struggling to confront the virus. Many cases had been observed where COVID-19 could not be identified at a specific time. Furthermore, any effective strategy that could monitor the coronavirus state in the human body had not been established. As a result, patients with the coronavirus could not receive proper treatment when necessary. Therefore, the death toll due to COVID-19 was rising. Although the situation of covid-19 has subsided currently, precautions need to be taken in advance to keep further waves at bay. This project proposes an approach to combat the COVID-19 pandemic more efficiently by using various machine learning algorithms and comparing their accuracy and using the best outcome to predict the disease. With eight binary features, the model was able to predict the COVID-19 test outcomes with high accuracy. When testing resources are few, this framework can be used, among other things, to prioritize testing for COVID-19.
